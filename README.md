# Keep Right!

I was inspired to make this very simple app due to the fact that i have a **small room** but got **tons of things** with me.

It was when i was "keeping" my things and i saw a padlock inside my laptop bag. This lock is what i use on my baggage to whenever i travel but i realized that by the time that i would need the use of it, i might not remember where was it again (i have poor **short-term memory** but has great **long-term memory**, with that i will never forget that my padlock is in my laptop bag, lol).

But still, if it happens that i kept something in a very normal manner which there won't be any significance why i have placed it there, i might forget it soon enough. I do have **categorization** however on where i put my things as well but i want it to be **automated** this time!

I am trying to learn `Golang` (Go) at the same time and now i will put everything i've read from the docs to test!

Since i am already aware on how to host **Serverless** apps on **AWS** and **Azure**, this time i will be trying out **Google Cloud Platform**.

Soon enough i will be testing out **Docker** which i have learned the **fundamentals** from **IBM**'s Online Course which will then i will test out their service.

Hoping for the Best!
